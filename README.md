# Library

This is a RESTful API project developed entirely upon C# on the Visual Studio IDE. It uses, 'Insomnia' as API client, and SQL Server as database.

'Library' as its name implies, is an API that serves as a library in a real-life scenario. It focuses on optimizing the main objective of a library, the book loan system. To carry out this service, a user management environment is implemented.

The real goal behind this web API is to demonstrate my skills as a C# web developer for any potential employer.
